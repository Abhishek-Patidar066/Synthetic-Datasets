# Synthetic-Datasets
Overview:   
This repository contains synthetic datasets designed for machine learning and data analysis tasks. The datasets feature a variety of patterns and structures, making them ideal for testing, benchmarking, and visualizing algorithms. Each dataset simulates unique distributions or geometrical patterns, such as moons, blobs, clusters, and more.

Datasets:    
Moon Pattern:  
A crescent moon-shaped dataset with two distinct classes forming semi-circular shapes.
Useful for evaluating clustering and classification algorithms in non-linear decision boundary scenarios.  

Blob Pattern:  
A set of isotropic Gaussian blobs for clustering.  
Adjustable parameters allow control over the number of clusters, cluster size, and standard deviation.      

Name-Like Patterns:    
Datasets resembling the shape of characters or words.
Often used for creative visualization or pattern recognition tasks.

Grid/Checkerboard Patterns:  
Structured grids or alternating square patterns.
Ideal for exploring spatial relationships and segmentation tasks.

Custom Shapes:  
Arbitrary shapes or patterns to simulate unique data distributions.
Can be used for specialized tasks like anomaly detection or unsupervised learning.  

Features:  
  
Customizable Parameters: Modify the size, density, noise, and dimensions to fit your requirements.  
Easy Integration: Datasets are provided in formats ready for popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.  
Versatility: Suitable for tasks like supervised/unsupervised learning, visualization, and algorithm prototyping.
